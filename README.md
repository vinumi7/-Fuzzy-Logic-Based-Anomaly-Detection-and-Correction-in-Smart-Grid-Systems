# -Fuzzy-Logic-Based-Anomaly-Detection-and-Correction-in-Smart-Grid-Systems
Developed a fuzzy logic-based system to detect and correct power anomalies in voltage, frequency, and  load balance. Implemented rule-based strategies such as load balancing and frequency regulation.  Optimized accuracy and tested with simulated anomalies to improve grid stability
